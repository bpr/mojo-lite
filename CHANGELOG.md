# Changelog

All notable changes to Mojito will be documented in this file. The project uses
Semantic Versioning while its public Rust API and supported Mojo subset continue
to evolve under the `0.x` compatibility rules.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15

Initial crates.io release.

### Added

- Indentation-sensitive lexer, Pratt parser, semantic checker, HIR and flattened
  MIR pipeline, ownership analysis, drop elaboration, and register VM.
- Functions, methods, structs, traits, generics, overloads, compile-time
  elaboration and VM-backed CTFE for the supported subset.
- Move checking, partial moves, ASAP destruction, stable origins, persistent
  loans, local and cross-call references, reference returns, and frame/slot
  runtime handles.
- Scalar, string, list, tuple, range, exception, iterator, unsafe-pointer, and
  VM-emulated `SIMD[...]` lane-vector semantics needed by the bundled self-hosted
  standard-library proofs. The VM executes lanes serially; hardware SIMD and
  native vector code generation are not included.
- Dotted and relative module linking with bundled `std` search roots.
- CLI stages for lexing, parsing, checking, ownership verification, and running
  `.mojo` source files.

### Scope

- Targets an evolving single-threaded CPU subset of Mojo.
- GPU execution, concurrency/parallelism, distributed execution, Python
  interoperability, MLIR, and optimized native code generation are not included.
